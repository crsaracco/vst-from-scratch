# vst-from-scratch

This creates a simple VST "from scratch", without depending on [`rust-vst`](https://github.com/rust-dsp/rust-vst).

It is not meant to replace `rust-vst` or be any sort of production-quality; it is simply used as a way for me to learn how the VST 2.4 specification works.

If you want to make a VST, I highly recommend just using [`rust-vst`](https://github.com/rust-dsp/rust-vst) instead of this.
